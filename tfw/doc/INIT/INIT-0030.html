Objective
</td>
<td>
This test case is intended to verify the following implied or specified requirements:
<br>
<ul>
<li> When the app is started by selecting from the Android app selection menu, the app shall do the following:</li>
<li> If the portfolio database does exist, the app shall query the public server to retrieve and store the latest closing price for each stock ticker in the portfolio and then display a blanked main menu.</li>
</ul>
The objective of this test case is to verify the above requirements.  This test will be executed following the first time the app is loaded onto the Android device.  At that point, a portfolio will exist so no database creation will be necessary and previously existing entries will be accessible.<br>
