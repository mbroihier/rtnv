<br>
<ul>
<li> When the enter button is pressed, rtnv shall send a retrieve request to the public server if the ticker field is not empty.</li>
<li> rtnv shall store a persistent copy of the ticker, number of shares, and value of each share in the persistent database.</li>
<li> rtnv shall store zero as the value of a share if the value can not be retrieved by the public server.</li>
<li> rtnv shall clear the ticker, number of shares, and value of each share fields at completion of processing.</li>
</ul>
The objective of this test case is to verify the requirements identified above which cover the entry of a stock into the portfolio which does not match an entry that can be retrieved by the public server.<br>
